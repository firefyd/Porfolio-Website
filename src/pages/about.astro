				<p class="text-text-secondary mb-2">
					My primary duties at Orbis have been the analysis of large-scale experimental data to further our goals in research and development. I have supported this work with the creation of Hippa and ISO compliant databases both for day-to-day operational work as well as clinical study data collection.
				</p>
				<p class="text-text-secondary mb-2">
					In addition to this, I have performed tasks as needed by Orbis, including:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-3 text-text-secondary mb-2">
					<li>
						Leading a project that reduced total production time by 30%, freeing up staff capacity to focus on higher-value, non-production tasks.
					</li>
					<li>
						Reviewing international regulations on software and data management in diagnostics, ultimately enabling me to author standard operating procedures to ensure ongoing ISO and regulatory compliance. Compliance in these areas is crucial to our ongoing FDA submission process.
					</li>
					<li>
						Performing internal audits to ensure ISO 13485 compliance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Conducting day-to-day hands-on production tasks to enable research. In support of this, I designed and produced multiple tools which reduced 'sticking points' in workflows.
					</li>
					<li>
					Preparing segments of documents for direct submission to the FDA and other regulatory bodies.
					</li>
				</ul>
